  <figcaption>Me (above person in front) along with my friends in the sand dunes</figcaption>
  <p>I'm an Eagle Scout so I love outdoor activities and camping. In the above picture my friends and I
  went to the Sand Dunes where we camped for 3 days. It was a weird and crazy experience. There was
  terrible wind, boiling days, freezing nights, no water, and only sand for miles. I don't like doing
  stuff that intense, but I can.</p>
  <h5>Some of my hobbies:</h5>
  <ul>
    <li>Video Games - love them, make them, study them</li>
    <li>Board Games with friends</li>
    <li>World Building - love making worlds and creating art around it</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Fun quote because why not</p>
